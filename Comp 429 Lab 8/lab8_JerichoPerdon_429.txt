Lab 8: TCP: conn. mgmt. 

Qanda

1) What field in the TCP header determines the length of the header?

Answer: The field in the TCP header that determines the length of the header is the TCP Data Offset, where
one word represents 4 bytes.

2) What is the minimum and maximum number of bytes a TCP header can have.

Answer: The minimum number of bytes a TCP header can have is 20 bytes while the maximum number is 60 bytes.

3) It is not possible to have a 23 byte header, why not? What is used to pad the data?

Answer: It is possible to have a 23 byte header because the length of a TCP header is typically 20 bytes, with
no options field. If there was an option field with an Option-Length of 3 bytes, the TCP header will have 23 bytes 
total.

4) What is required for a TCP segment to be considered valid for a given connection?

Answer: A connection between the client and server needs to be established for a TCP segment to be 
considered valid for a given connection.

5) You notice a TCP SYN packet with the same 4-tuple occurring at regular intervals in a packet capture. 
Those time interval since the first packet sent seems to be 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s, and 64s. 
What is this behavior called?

Answer: The behavior is called in-window or Predictable Number Sequence.



TCP Printout

1) The Ethernet header is 14 bytes, the IP header is 20 bytes, TCP header begins on the byte immediately after. 
Highlight the sequence numbers and acknowledgment numbers of each packet.

2) Draw a diagram, similar to Figure 13-1, and include the actual sequence/acknowledgment numbers of the exchange.

3) Add to your diagram, the TCP state each connection is in. See Figure 13-9 as a reference.
